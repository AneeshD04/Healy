// Note: To complete the "open eyes on hover" effect, you'll need to:
//
// 1. Create a version of the brain image with open eyes
// 2. Save it as "/images/brain-eyes-open.png"
//
// The hover functionality is already implemented in the code.
// When users hover over the brain, it will switch to the open-eyes version.
//
// If you don't have the open-eyes image yet, the code includes a fallback
// that will continue to show the closed-eyes version until you add the new image.
